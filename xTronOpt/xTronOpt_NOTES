#### Error code information ####
In the _dev files, you will now see an error code. The flags are as follows:
 1. abs(lowest_e - last_e) > consistency_thres  ->  1
 2. abs(lowest_e - cycle0_e) < difference_thres  ->  10
 3. lowest_cycle == 0  -> 100

#### FOR NEW xTron OPTIMIZATION ####
MORE .EXAMPLE FILES HAVE BEEN CREATED. Specifically in the mol_sets, the list_of_atoms and list_of_molecules
 files are now .example files that need to be copied over to list_of_atoms and list_of_molecules respectively.
 This is to avoid conflicts in git.

 1. Need to create a pop.txt, or file equivalent, for nonlinear parameter sets.
 (Need to create a linear_params.txt file for linear parameter sets. (HAS TO BE CALLED linear_params.txt))
    NOTE: IF YOU PLAN TO DO ANY LINEAR LEAST SQUARES FITTING THEN YOU MUST HAVE A LINEAR_PARAMS.TXT FILE FOR
     ERROR CALCULATION AND SORTING TO WORK. USE THE EXAMPLE(DEFAULT) 
  It is expected that there are 2 nonlinear parameters and 3 linear parameters.  Step 2 is optional. 
  If there is no linear_params.txt file then it uses the defaults in xcfunc.conf.  
  If there is 1 set of parameters, it uses that set for all nonlinear parameters. Otherwise, there must
   be a 1 to 1 set for nonlinear and linear.
 2. An xTronOpt_config.txt MUST BE CREATED. Please use the example as a template. This specifies where
    the xTron source code is located so settings and executable can be grabbed for job_setup.sh to be used.

Some changes and additions:
- Reworked some things to allow G3_LARGE.BAS to be used externally
   from xTron input files.
- Edited least squares scripts for, hopefully, more readability.
- Added a config script to the upper level for ease of use with git.

Still needs work:
- Need to rework the resubmittion script or code some sort of eden equivalent
   for ease of resubmitting the job or rerunning certain molecules. Also run
   multiple molecules at once.

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE OF mol_sets
- mol_sets is the directory which contains atoms and molecules for investigation.
- At the top level we have template1.txt and template2.txt, necessary for the
   construction of the input files for the job.
- sets_list.txt are the names of all the sets of molecules. For now we have
   diatomics and polyatomics. Puttng an asterix in front of the molecule set
   in sets_list.txt will ignore that set and will run none of the molecules from it.
- The first directory atoms, contains the list_of_atoms files and corresponding 
   pieces of input files. Putting an asterix in front of an atom will ignore it.
- The directories for diatomics and polyatomics are similar. They contain the pieces
   required for the final input file as well as a list_of_molecules. Same result for
   an asterix in front of the molecule applies here. It should also contain 
   exp_{set_name} which should contain the experimental/exact values for the
   disassociation energy of the molecules.
- mem_infor_files are necessary files for running xTron.

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE OF IO_files
- IO_files is where the output files for each generation will go. It will have
   gen1, gen2, .. etc. Removing or renaming the whole folder will free up the # value 
   when rerunning run_pop.sh.
- Within the gen# folder, there will be a population.txt file which will have the 
   parameter sets investigated in this generation. It will also have an atoms directory
   and any sets used. job_files is where any files related to the whole job will go.
   scripts_configs is the directory where any necessary scripts and config files will
   go specific to the parameter set.
- After running the error calculation, you will see {set_name}_dev which will have the deviation
   for all the molecules of the set. gen_errors.txt which will contain the errors associated with
   all the parameter sets.

Other things of note when working with xTron.
- All parameters should be specified in the xcfunc.conf file.
- There are 3 necessary environmental variables that need to be set:
   - XTRON_SETTING_FILE - where the xcfunc.conf is (requires that name specifically so each
       parameter set must have a unique XTRON_SETTING_FILE)
   - XTRON_BASIS_SET_HOME - where the basis set file is. Basis set file must be in all caps and
       is specified within the pieces of the input file in mol_sets. Ex. G3LARGE.BAS
   - XTRON_SCRATCH_DIR - where a scratch directory is to hold temporary files. Should be cleaned
       periodically.

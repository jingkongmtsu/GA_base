This document is a tutorial on how to use the least squares scripts.

After running the error calculation using either err_iter.sh or calc_gen_error.pl,
 you will find a file called all_values.txt. This text file contains the pieces of
 all relevant values used to calculated the the matrix and vector needed for the
 least squares fitting. Another file is called gen_stats.txt which contiains the
 calculated MAD and SumSqs values for the generation. The first step to run the
 least squares process is to run:

1. perl lstsq_create_bA.pl IO_files/gen#/all_values#.txt

This will create a file in the same directory called lstsq_Ab#.txt where the number
 sign is the same number as the one following all_values#.txt. The next step is to
 actually calculate the coefficients. You must use the python script which also 
 uses numpy. So far only the workstation has a working python with numpy.

2. python lstsq_fit.py IO_files/gen#/lstsq_Ab#.txt
 (recommended: python lstsq_fit.py IO_files/gen#/lstsq_Ab#.txt > IO_files/gen#/lstsq_fitted_coeffs#.txt)

This will print the fitted linear coefficients to standard output. You must store these coefficients
 to be used in the future. I suggest using the recommended line above. Next, calculate the 
 theoretical MAD and SumSqs values using this new set of coefficients. This is done using:

3. perl lstsq_calc_theo_stats.pl IO_files/gen#/all_values#.txt IO_files/gen#/gen_stats.txt IO_files/gen#/lstsq_fitted_coeffs#.txt

This will create a file in called IO_files/gen#/lstsq_stats#.txt which contains the theoretical
 MAD and SumSqs using this new set of fitted linear coefficients.

These coefficients must now be put into linear_params.txt in the xTronOpt folder to be used
 to run the molecules and atoms over again. 

4. ./run_pop.sh xTronOpt/pop.txt              # (with the new linear parameters)

After these calculations are done, the previous statistics must be compared to the current statistics. 
 To do that run:

5. perl lstsq_compare_orig_to_fitted.pl IO_files/gen#/lstsq_stats#.txt IO_files/gen{#+1}/gen_stats.txt #

The final number sign is which line in gen_stats.txt in the fitted coefficient results you would like to
 compare to the original results. This will create a file in IO_files/gen{#+1}/ called compare_stats_lstsq#.txt
 which will have all three comparisons: Original, theoretical fitted coefficient results, calculated fitted coefficient results.
